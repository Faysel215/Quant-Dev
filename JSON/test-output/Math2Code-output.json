Users would upload a set of source images or define procedural patterns (e.g., gradients, shapes) which act as a **basis** for the art space. The application then generates new artwork by creating a random **linear combination** of these basis vectors. The creative output is a direct visualization of the **span** of the user's chosen basis. Users could experiment with the **dimension** of their art space by adding or removing basis vectors, and discover how a **linearly dependent** basis (e.g., one image being a composite of two others) restricts the variety of the generated art.",
