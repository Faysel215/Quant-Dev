## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Intuition & Deconstruction
*Develop a high-level, intuitive 'feel' for the concept before diving into rigorous proofs.*

- [Add notes on intuition, analogies, and visual explanations here...]

### Phase 2: Formalization & Proof
*Engage with the rigorous definitions, theorems, and proofs.*

- **Formal Definition:** `$$ [Paste LaTeX for definition here] $$`
- **Key Proofs:**
  - [Link to Proof 1](./proofs/proof_1.md)

### Phase 3: Technique & Generalization
*Master the computational techniques and see how the concept connects to the broader mathematical landscape.*

- [Add notes on common formulas, techniques, and connections to other fields...]

### Phase 4: Problem Solving & Application
*Achieve mastery by solving non-trivial problems.*

- **Solved Problems:**
  - [Link to Problem 1](./problems/problem_1.md)
