First, use the `read_document` tool to read the content of the `template_file_name`. This string will serve as your structural guide. 2. Next, use the `read_document` tool to extract the text content from the source `file_name`. 3. Thoroughly scan the extracted source text to identify all key terms that are formally defined. 4. For EACH identified term, populate the structure from the template string with the corresponding information (formal definition, intuition, related proofs) you extract and synthesize from the source text. 5. The final output must be a list containing a separate, complete Markdown file object for each definition you identified.",
